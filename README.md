# [Python Script Junk Drawer](https://github.com/trianglebreaker/python_script_junk_drawer)

A collection of assorted Python scripts that I made for whatever purpose. There's no rhyme or reason to what they're forâ€”thus, the "junk drawer" name. If anything here seems useful or interesting to you in the slightest, go nuts! It's all open source, so it's free to use, modify, distribute, slow-cook over an open fire, whatever.

## List of Scripts

Detailed usage instructions can be found in each script's folder.
